      "description": "Our Concealed Weapons Permit class gives you the necessary training to be a responsible gun owner and carrier. In the classroom portion, we cover home safety, basic weapon handling and marksmanship, and principles of concealed carry. Then we put it into practice on the range.\n\nThis is a two-day course that starts with a four to five-hour interactive classroom setting where we will present the how-to’s of safe and tactical handgun use.\n\nHere are some questions this class will answer:\n\n-   What are the cardinal rules of handgun safety?\n-   How do I safely and tactically operate my handgun?\n-   What handgun functions are critical to know in order to defend myself or others?\n-   How do I know if I am in a deadly force situation?\n-   How and when do I use my handgun to defend myself or others?\n-   How does repetitive, technically perfect training affect my abilities with my handgun?\n-   What do I need to do after a deadly force encounter?\n-   What is the significance and/or importance of ongoing training?\n-   What are the rules for carrying a handgun in Idaho?\n-   What are the benefits of the Idaho Enhanced Concealed Weapons Permit?\n\nThe second part of this class is four to five hours on the range. In this portion of the class, we will conduct a safety brief and go over the rules of the range and then do dry practice, implementing the skills discussed in the classroom portion. After dry practice, we will conduct live-fire drills, focusing on learning and practicing the fundamental principles of tactical handgun manipulation.\n",

Understanding the basics of internal, external and terminal ballistics is a crucial part of long range shooting. If you miss a target, we want you, the shooter, to be able determine what you think was the cause of the miss. This way you will be able to correct it in the field, and score a second round hit. We will then go over basic scope set up and function prior to any live firing. Only 2 hours of classroom for this course. All other instruction will take place during live fire on the range.\n\n**All shooting will be done from the Prone Shooting Position**. Proper positioning behind the rifle is essential to consistent long range shooting. We will then begin our 100 yard sight in confirmations. Shooters MUST show up with their rifle zeroed at 100 yards. Some adjustments may need to be made, so we will take our time to get this correct for each shooter.\n\nOnce all shooters are sighted in, we will begin to engage targets at increasing distances. Shooters will begin logging elevation and windage data for each distance. Target distances we can expect to reach 1000 yards by the end of the day! We will have steel targets set up from 200-1000 yards, including each 50 yard increment.\n\nWe Will Break For Lunch, we will provide burgers, hot dogs, sides and beverages for everyone on Friday. We have a grill available for students to use at the firing line.

Spotting scopes will be available for students to use to spot for each other. Feel free to bring other rifles if you like, we can help you get quick data on them.\n\n**DAY 2** – Meet at the range at 8:00 and start the day with a long range cold bore shot. We will go over any questions anyone may have from the prior day, then back to shooting.\n\nDay 2 will include doping the range for the change in atmospheric conditions and confirming each yardage.

Classroom from 8am-10am. We will go over scope operation and setup and discuss some basic ballistics that will be effecting our bullets path to the target. Understanding the basics of internal, external and terminal ballistics is a crucial part of long range shooting. If you miss a target, we want you, the shooter, to be able determine what you think was the cause of the miss. This way you will be able to correct it in the field, and score a second round hit. We will then go over basic scope set up and function prior to any live firing. Only 2 hours of classroom for this course. All other instruction will take place during live fire on the range.\n\n**All shooting will be done from the Prone Shooting Position**. Proper positioning behind the rifle is essential to consistent long range shooting. We will then begin our 100 yard sight in confirmations. Shooters MUST show up with their rifle zeroed at 100 yards. Some adjustments may need to be made, so we will take our time to get this correct for each shooter.\n\nOnce all shooters are sighted in, we will begin to engage targets at increasing distances. Shooters will begin logging elevation and windage data for each distance. Target distances we can expect to reach 1000 yards by the end of the day! We will have steel targets set up from 200-1000 yards, including each 50 yard increment.\n\nWe Will Break For Lunch, we will provide burgers, hot dogs, sides and beverages for everyone on Friday. We have a grill available for students to use at the firing line. Feel free to bring coolers, portable grills, lawn chairs, etc\n\nWe will break for the day around 4:30 PM, but the line will stay hot until 5 PM for shooters who feel they need extra work, need to make adjustments, or just want to bang steel. Spotting scopes will be available for students to use to spot for each other. Feel free to bring other rifles if you like, we can help you get quick data on them.\n\n**DAY 2** – Meet at the range at 8:00 and start the day with a long range cold bore shot. We will go over any questions anyone may have from the prior day, then back to shooting.\n\nDay 2 will include doping the range for the change in atmospheric conditions and confirming each yardage. We will do some new UKD drills(unknown distance estimation) and we have NEW life size animal targets out in the field for 2022 for you hunters.

        "description": "**This is an Advanced Beginner / Intermediate course.**\n\n**We hope to move this course along faster than previous years with the addition of our beginner course.**\n\n_For those who have good long range rifle setup, a basic knowledge of how a scope works, and regularly shoot 100-200 yards._\n\n_If you can shoot a 1 inch group at 100 yards, this is the course for you._\n\n**2 Day Course – Price $750.00 per shooter: (deposit of $350 due when you register, balance due the day of the course)**\n\n**DAY 1**– 8 AM Check in at clubhouse and go over safety rules and procedures. Classroom from 8am-10am. We will go over scope operation and setup and discuss some basic ballistics that will be effecting our bullets path to the target. Understanding the basics of internal, external and terminal ballistics is a crucial part of long range shooting. If you miss a target, we want you, the shooter, to be able determine what you think was the cause of the miss. This way you will be able to correct it in the field, and score a second round hit. We will then go over basic scope set up and function prior to any live firing. Only 2 hours of classroom for this course. All other instruction will take place during live fire on the range.\n\n**All shooting will be done from the Prone Shooting Position**. Proper positioning behind the rifle is essential to consistent long range shooting. We will then begin our 100 yard sight in confirmations. Shooters MUST show up with their rifle zeroed at 100 yards. Some adjustments may need to be made, so we will take our time to get this correct for each shooter.\n\nOnce all shooters are sighted in, we will begin to engage targets at increasing distances. Shooters will begin logging elevation and windage data for each distance. Target distances we can expect to reach 1000 yards by the end of the day! We will have steel targets set up from 200-1000 yards, including each 50 yard increment.\n\nWe Will Break For Lunch, we will provide burgers, hot dogs, sides and beverages for everyone on Friday. We have a grill available for students to use at the firing line. Feel free to bring coolers, portable grills, lawn chairs, etc\n\nWe will break for the day around 4:30 PM, but the line will stay hot until 5 PM for shooters who feel they need extra work, need to make adjustments, or just want to bang steel. Spotting scopes will be available for students to use to spot for each other. Feel free to bring other rifles if you like, we can help you get quick data on them.\n\n**DAY 2** – Meet at the range at 8:00 and start the day with a long range cold bore shot. We will go over any questions anyone may have from the prior day, then back to shooting.\n\nDay 2 will include doping the range for the change in atmospheric conditions and confirming each yardage.

        "description": "**This is an Advanced Beginner / Intermediate course.**\n\n**We hope to move this course along faster than previous years with the addition of our beginner course.**\n\n_For those who have good long range rifle setup, a basic knowledge of how a scope works, and regularly shoot 100-200 yards._\n\n_If you can shoot a 1 inch group at 100 yards, this is the course for you._\n\n**2 Day Course – Price $750.00 per shooter: (deposit of $350 due when you register, balance due the day of the course)**\n\n**DAY 1**– 8 AM Check in at clubhouse and go over safety rules and procedures. Classroom from 8am-10am. We will go over scope operation and setup and discuss some basic ballistics that will be effecting our bullets path to the target. Understanding the basics of internal, external and terminal ballistics is a crucial part of long range shooting. If you miss a target, we want you, the shooter, to be able determine what you think was the cause of the miss. This way you will be able to correct it in the field, and score a second round hit. We will then go over basic scope set up and function prior to any live firing. Only 2 hours of classroom for this course. All other instruction will take place during live fire on the range.\n\n**All shooting will be done from the Prone Shooting Position**. Proper positioning behind the rifle is essential to consistent long range shooting. We will then begin our 100 yard sight in confirmations. Shooters MUST show up with their rifle zeroed at 100 yards. Some adjustments may need to be made, so we will take our time to get this correct for each shooter.\n\nOnce all shooters are sighted in, we will begin to engage targets at increasing distances. Shooters will begin logging elevation and windage data for each distance. Target distances we can expect to reach 1000 yards by the end of the day! We will have steel targets set up from 200-1000 yards, including each 50 yard increment.\n\nWe Will Break For Lunch, we will provide burgers, hot dogs, sides and beverages for everyone on Friday. We have a grill available for students to use at the firing line. Feel free to bring coolers, portable grills, lawn chairs, etc\n\nWe will break for the day around 4:30 PM, but the line will stay hot until 5 PM for shooters who feel they need extra work, need to make adjustments, or just want to bang steel. Spotting scopes will be available for students to use to spot for each other. Feel free to bring other rifles if you like, we can help you get quick data on them.\n\n**DAY 2** – Meet at the range at 8:00 and start the day with a long range cold bore shot. We will go over any questions anyone may have from the prior day, then back to shooting.\n\nDay 2 will include doping the range for the change in atmospheric conditions and confirming each yardage. We will do some new UKD drills(unknown distance estimation) and we have NEW life size animal targets out in the field for 2022 for you hunters. WE will continue reticle work on day 2, and shoot the field using our scopes reticle. We will end the day with a NEW final drill to determine the TOP SHOT.
