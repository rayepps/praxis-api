Cancellations after 2/15/22 will result in a $250 withdrawal fee if the slot cannot be filled. If you cancel your registration prior to that date, you may receive your payment refunded, less a 3% transaction fee charged by payment processing company. Curriculum: Space allowing, we will set up a full stage, for students to run through at the beginning of class. The stage will include a number of elements such as entries and exits, opportunities to shoot on the move, awkward positions, close and far targets, and high risk arrays. This first run through will be an assessment tool, helping the instructor to figure out your shooting style and where improvements can be made. Throughout the class we will occasionally revisit this stage, and use parts of it to isolate and develop skills, and set up drills. Classes consist of 10-13 students, and are two days long. Classes are focused on the practical shooting skills that will help you more confidently plan, tackle, and shave time from your performance with a pistol. While this class does contain some advanced fundamentals, the class is mostly dynamic and stage oriented. Because this class doesn’t include a great deal of “firing line” type fundamentals training, we wont burn through ammo like a regular class. Therefore, the round counts are bit lower than what you might have seen at traditional 2-day classes in the past – we will make them count. I am a firm believer that when it comes to proper practice, quality is much more important than quantity, so this class will also cover principles of efficient practice, and how to structure your practices to identify and address your weaknesses. Students should plan on bringing a lunch. In addition, we'll be covering: Day 1 1. Overview of gear setup/optimization 2. Small discussion on grip/stance/draws 3. Group shooting 4. Dot drills w/o timer and w/ timer 5. Discussion/demo on importance of trigger control and sight management 6. Strong hand and weak hand shooting 7. Transitions 8. Sight deviation and acceptable risk 9. Shot calling 10. Putting it all together (4 aces, El Prez, Accelerator) Day 2 1. Movement (side to side, downrange/uprange) 2. Positioning and how to set up properly (barricades, ports, leans) 3. Entries/Exits 4. Importance of having gun up ready to shoot ALWAYS 5. Stage planning (visualization, self talk) 6. Stage shooting and performance improvement and evaluation</p>",tactical,https://practiscore.com/events/2-day-practical-performance-at-lopez-canyon-shooting-park-presented-by-raven-wing-llc/participants/create,raven-wing-limited,advanced; handgun-pistol,$530,

The R.A.I.D. Tactical Engagement System was developed over years of study, combat, training, and mastering the skills needed to not only fight in modern combat on the battlefield but also to train others the same systems for their survival. This system relies on the individual to master the individual skills of multiple weapons systems, but also themselves and their mindset to overcome adversity and challenge. No one is perfect or knows everything, but with the support of other Warriors training together, we learn the art of fighting is not just about the individual but the team. When we as Warriors bring strong individual skills to the fight, we then come together as a team with strong team skills that prove nothing is impossible. The impossible just takes a while to accomplish. We cannot do it alone, we cannot do it with the wrong mindset, we cannot do it without support for and from others. We do it together. Each Warrior is a link in the fighting chain, a cog in the wheel of the machine that moves the fight to the enemy, that builds Initiative that cannot be overcome. But it takes each individual Warrior to do his part, to train as hard as he can, to build the strength he needs to hold the line, to hold the standard. The helmet he wears is to protect himself, the Sword he carries is to kill his enemy, the shield he carries is for the man next to him. To protect his fellow Warrior in the fray, when they stand together to form and hold the line.</p><p>The R.A.I.D Warrior program is not for everyone. It is for the few that, no matter where they are in life, have decided to stand with others and train the skills of battle. To test themselves against others, with others, for others. This program is not for the faint at heart or the weak. Physical Strength can be built, endurance can be trained but courage cannot. It can only be tested. The R.A.I.D. Warrior program is for those people that want to test themselves, train themselves and test against and with others.</p><p>When a person commits to the R.A.I.D. Warrior Program they are committing to themselves to be a better person- Physically, Mentally, and Spiritually- and members of the community.</p><p>All that enroll and follow the R.A.I.D. Warrior Program will receive discounts on training courses. Discounts on Matches, Individual and group training, and fellowship into the Warrior Culture. Only you can decide to join, only you can reap the benefits of the skills of battle. Starting at THE BASIC LEVEL is the first step to Master. All Masters started as beginners, and thru hard work, persistence, and suffering they became Masters, mentors, trainers, and</p><p>‍</p>",survival,https://www.thecombatuniversity.com/,raidon-tactics,beginner; self-defense; handgun-pistol; womens,,

No matter if it is a bolt gun (match grade only), semi-automatic pistol or even our shotguns we have found that brass cased ammo makes all firearm types run more smoothly than steel or aluminum. We understand that with the AK-47 it was designed for steel so that is OK. We also realize that brass cased ammo typically costs 10-15% more than steel but you have already invested so much in your training why would you want less than the best ammo so you can get the absolute MOST from your investment? If you choose to use steel anyway please do not complain to us that our guns won't work...they work just fine with brass. <strong>You are REQUIRED to clean and lubricate your loaner gun after each day of training and before you return it.</strong></p><p><strong>BUYING MULTIPLE SPOTS IN THE CLASS</strong> - If you're buying a spot in the class for more than one person please email Info@TacticalResponse.com or call 877-7LETHAL with the names of all students attending.</p><p>*You will only receive a certificate of successful completion by participating 100% in class.
